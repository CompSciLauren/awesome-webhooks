# Awesome Webhooks

> :anchor: Easy-to-use webhooks for automating tasks during various software development workflows.

"Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, GitHub will send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server. You're only limited by your imagination." - [GitHub Webhooks Documentation](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/)
